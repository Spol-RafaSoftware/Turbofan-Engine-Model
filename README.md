# Turbofan-Engine-Model
In order to accurately output the correct thrust, thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), engine noise, and CO2 emmisions throughout the flight in our senior aircraft design project: design and build a working aircraft with 100% code, an acurate engine model had to be designed. This was accomplished by analyzing a non-afterburning turbofan without aid of ideal assumptions. Calculations were performed at each stage of the cycle: freestream, ram compression, deceleration, fan, fan exhaust, compressor, combustor, turbine, core nozzle, and core exhaust. Once these baselines were established, the model was refined to meet the specifications of high bypass current generation turbofan engines. With these modifications, the code produced thrust and TSFC values that were comparable to many current engine designs. Finally, the bypass ratio and weight equations were fitted to match that of the selected engine, the Pratt and Whitney PW1000G geared turbofan. Using this method also allowed the engine to be scaled to create a fan diameter based on any thrust requirement at any condition, including the maximum needed to complete the mission.
